### Core principle of Tailwind css ?
The core principle of Tailwind CSS is **utility-first styling**. Instead of writing custom CSS, you use pre-defined utility classes to style elements directly in your HTML. These utility classes are:

- **Single-purpose**: Focused on one task (e.g., `p-4` for padding, `text-center` for text alignment).
- **Composability**: You combine multiple small classes to build complex designs.
- **Customization**: You can easily customize themes like colors, spacing, and typography via a configuration file.

This approach promotes **rapid development** and **consistency** in design across a project.
